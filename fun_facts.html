                    My life is not just coding and university coursework. In fact, the vast majority of events that
                    shaped
                    me as an
                    individual happened outside of classroom. If you are reading this section right now, it probably
                    means
                    that my
                    professional self has interested you. Thank you for that! In this section, I would like to share
                    some of
                    the dearest
                    experiences to my heart that have shaped me as an individual, taught me self-discipline and
                    perseverance, and shown
                    that communication is the most important skill one must have.

                    Before coming to the US, I spent two years in the northeast of Italy, at UWC Adriatic, one of the
                    United
                    World College
                    movement's institutions. This movement aspires to make education a force to unite people, nations
                    and
                    cultures for peace
                    and a sustainable future. To do that, UWC Adriatic brings 180 students from more than 90 countries
                    to
                    pursue the
                    rigorous International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma.

                    Living at this residential school was demanding yet truly transformational. Just think about it, you
                    spend two years
                    with 180 students with different in any way possible backgrounds under the same roof on the
                    beautiful
                    coast of the
                    Adriatic sea. What an immense learning opportunity! It were the small quarrels with fellow students
                    from
                    a plethora of
                    backgrounds that taught me patience and key conflict resolution skills; it were the long study
                    sessions
                    with my friends
                    that created the unbreakable bonds between us and taught me that people are one's main asset.
